- make glamor accelerated xorg work for legacy kernel
  - this seems to be a problem mostly for the older 4.x kernels and is most probably gone with v5.10 etc.
- add maybe still missing firmware
- make wifi in those chromebooks work reliable (currently it sees the wifi networks, but does not connect properly)
  - with the v5.10 legacy kernel it seems to work
- make sound working for the mainline kernel
- make the missing parts of sound working for the legacy kernel
  - headphones and the internal mic do not work yet
- think about ways to add some support for initrd loading which is required for instance for luks encrypted root fs
  - problem: the depthcharge bootloader does not support initrd loading on intel systems (on arm systems it is supported)
  - maybe try to do it by including a small generic initrd into the kernel which then loads the remaining and specific parts from /boot (postmarketos is using a similar strategy with only a tiny initial initrd for systems which do not support normal sized initrds)
- maybe have a look at https://github.com/MrChromebox/scripts/issues/89#issuecomment-1181326697 - looks like uefi firmware without the need to change the ro part of the flash
  - some success - see: https://github.com/hexdump0815/coreboot-cb-rw-uefi-payload
