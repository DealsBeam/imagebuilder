# required firmware

for certain functionalities of the qcom sc7180 (7c) like gpu, wifi and most
proably quite a few more to work firmware files are required. this document
is the try to collect information about what is needed and where it can be
obtained from. some of the files are part of the linux-firmware repo and some
will have to be copied from the windows installation of the device as the
firmware is often signed. the firmware files can usually be found at the
path C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository in the windows
installation. in a wsl shell on windows this means we are interested in the
following files:
```
cd /mnt/c/Windows/System32/DriverStore/FileRepository
tar czf /tmp/windows-firmware.tar.gz */*.mbn */*.jsn
```
from this archive it is possible to pick the required firmware files then
later for the linux side - the actual files are in subfolders and for some
there are multiple versions around - in those cases the latest should be the
best.

for this and other reasons it is a good idea to leave a windows installation
on the device - only this way it is possible to get firmware and bios updates
and besides that some information useful for linux bringup can be found in
*.inf files and the registry in windows.

## required firmware files for the acer aspire 1

for this system the following files have to be put into
/lib/firmware/qcom/sc7180/acer/aspire1:
```
adspr.jsn
adspua.jsn
cdspr.jsn
modemr.jsn
modemuw.jsn
qcadsp7180.mbn
qccdsp7180.mbn
qcdxkmsuc7180.mbn
qcmpss7180.mbn
qcmpss7180_nm.mbn
qcvss7180.mbn
wlanmdsp.mbn
```
and the following file has to be put additionally as well into
/lib/firmware/ath10k/WCN3990/hw1.0 (at least it has to be put there in case
wifi does not work properly with the original file, for instance it might
properly connect to the wifi without working network connections in the end)
```
wlanmdsp.mbn
```
for gpu functionality only qcdxkmsuc7180.mbn is required, the other files are
required for things like wifi, video decoding, audio etc.

## steps required to enable gpu support with the firmware files in place

after the firmware files were put into place as described above the following
steps have to be run as root on the system in order to enable gpu support in
xorg:
```
cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d.samples/11-modesetting.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/11-fbdev.conf
update-initramfs -c -k $(uname -r)
systemctl enable pd-mapper
apt-mark hold firmware-atheros
```
after a reboot freedreno support should be enabled in xorg if everything is
setup correctly and at least wifi should work as well. the last line is there
to avoid the wlanmdsp.mbn file to get overwritten by firmware-atheros package
updates in case the windows firware file has been put into
/lib/firmware/ath10k/WCN3990/hw1.0
