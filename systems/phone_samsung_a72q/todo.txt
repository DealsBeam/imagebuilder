- test if a kernel built from the v6.0 branch of the map220v tree works too
- try to port the sm7125 support to v6.1 to have at least a lts version with it
- try to maybe port it forward further (maybe there is already some sm7125 mainlining effort?)
- change kernel config to be based on aarch64 defconfig and remove more unused options
- try to get usb host power working if possible
- write s simple script to extract the required firmware from the android partitions
- simplify the kernel build and installation
